figure out routes for API calls to server and put in routes.rb
  mostly have them now

come back and fix async issues with fetch in index.html.erb

figure out what format backbone routers expect the controlled element to be in
  what the routes look like as URLS




Edit form:
  turn form into a js object using serialize on the form var
  use that object to set the attributes on this.model
  tell the model to save
    on success, redirect back to index page
    on failure, render the form with errors
